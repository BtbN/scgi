Summary of changes
==================

1.13 (XXXX-XX-XX)
-----------------

Neil Schemenauer <nas@arctrix.com>:
    Ensure that PATH_INFO is correct even when mod_rewrite modifies
    r->path_info.  One way this could happen is if the path being served
    by SCGI exists on the filesystem.  The fix was pointed out by David
    Binger.


1.12 (2006-10-02)
-----------------

Jeroen T. Vermeulen <jtv@thaiopensource.org>
    Provide a new overridable method in SCGIHandler, produce(), as a more
    user-friendly alternative to handle_connection().  Another new
    alternative is produce_cgilike() which receives the request payload on
    standard input and is expected to write its results to standard
    output.

Neil Schemenauer <nas@arctrix.com>:
    Define the CMSG_LEN and CMSG_SPACE macros if the platform doesn't
    provide them.

Jeroen T. Vermeulen <jtv@thaiopensource.org>
    Add guide.html document.


1.11 (released 2006-08-14)
--------------------------

Joseph Tate <jtate@rpath.com>:
    Allow SCGIServer to use an open socket if provided by the calling
    procedure.  The existing serve() method remains the same.

Neil Schemenauer <nas@arctrix.com>:
    Improve portability of the passfd module (solves at least one bug on
    AMD64 machines).

Neil Schemenauer <nas@arctrix.com>:
    Fix a mod_scgi bug that caused a segfault (due to a NULL pointer
    dereference) with certain configurations.  Thanks to Thomas Yandell
    for helping track down the bug.

Neil Schemenauer <nas@arctrix.com>:
    Don't send duplicated headers for SCRIPT_NAME and HTTPS.

Neil Schemenauer <nas@arctrix.com>:
    Update README and LICENSE files.
