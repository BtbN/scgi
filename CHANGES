1.10 (2006-02-01) r27892

  * Compile fixes for Apache 2.2.0 (some APR functions have been renamed).


1.9 (2005-12-13) r27717

  * Make passfd.c work on 64-bit machines. Thanks to Dryice Liu.

  * For Apache 2, set REQUEST_URI using the original request URI
    (r->unparsed_uri may be different if there was a redirect).


1.8 (2005-10-18) r27556

  * Pass all HTTP headers to SCGI servers.

  * Relax address family specification (allows IPv6).

  * In some versions of Apache, ap_sock_disable_nagle() is not always
    available.  Use lower-level API.


1.7 (2005-08-17) r27222

  * Fix another bug in Apache 2 mod_scgi implementation of SCGIMount.

  * Make the SCGIServerTimeout directive work for SCGIMount and allow
    it at the server level.

  * Change SCGIHandler to default to "On" (instead of Off).  Make the
    SCGIHandler option work with SCGIMount.


1.6 (2005-08-11) r27186

  * Fix bugs in Apache 2 mod_scgi implementation of SCGIMount directive.


1.5 (2005-08-10) r27184

  * Implement SCGIMount directive for mod_scgi.  In addition to being
    simpler than SCGIServer and SCGIHandler, it allows the PATH_INFO
    variable to be properly set (thanks to Ian Bicking for suggesting
    the idea).


1.4 (2005-06-15) r26909

  * Have cgi2scgi.c send all environment variables to the SCGI server, not
    just a fixed set of CGI related ones.

  * Fix connection retry logic.  The code in cgi2scgi.c and
    apache1/mod_scgi.c was non-portable and the apache2/mod_scgi.c code
    was completely broken.


1.3 (2005-06-02) r26869

  * Change mod_scgi to include environment variables in the SCGI
    request (thanks to Charles Hornberger).

  * Add read_env() function to scgi_server module.

  * Add note to README about using scgi_server.py script from Quixote 2.
    (thanks to Mike Orr).

  * Work around a conditional request Apache bug.  One symptom of the bug
    was that Apache would send a 200 response when the status should have
    been some special status like 304.


1.2 (2004-07-20) r24736

  * Fix "SCGIHandler On/Off" option for Apache 2 module.

  * Add CGI to SCGI adaptor.  Tweak quixote_handler so that it doesn't
    throw away PATH_INFO information (mod_scgi doesn't use it but CGI
    does).


1.2a2 (2004-02-27) r23588

  * Fix a major bug in ns_reads().  It used to read too much data if
    the entire contents of the netstring were not returned by the
    first read().

  * In the Apache 2 version of mod_scgi, implement buffered write
    functions for sockets. Use them instead of the APR buckets
    implementation when sending data to the SCGI server. The code using
    buckets was almost certainly wrong.

  * Add a 'translate' hook for the Apache 2 module.  That way the
    handler does not need to be set explicitly (matching the behavior of
    the 1.3 module).

  * Send the HTTP_HOST header to the SCGI server.

  * Include Python.h before any other headers.

  * Remove pid file if SCGI server receives SIGTERM.


1.2a1 (2003-07-28) r22096

  * add mod_scgi implementation for Apache 2


1.1 (2003-07-02) r21963

  mod_scgi.c

    * Pass HTTP/1.1 request headers to SCGI servers.
      
  passfd.c

    * Try to make passfd compile on OpenBSD and older versions of Solaris.

  scgi_server.py

    * Merge Jon Corbet's graceful restart patch.


1.0 (2003-05-29) r21747

  quixote_handler.py

    * Add -m option to specify the maximum number of children (from
      Jonathan Corbet).

  passfd.c

    * Remove some dead code (spotted by Jonathan Corbet).


1.0b1 (2003-02-07)

  mod_scgi.c

    * Reset the timeout while reading the request body.  This allows
      large file uploads without the connection being reset.

    * Slight simplification of cmd_server and cmd_handler.

  quixote_handler.py

    * By default, bind to local IP address 127.0.0.1 instead of 0.  Allow
      the local address to be specified.

  scgi_server.py

    * After receiving a passed socket, explicitly set it to non-blocking.
      This works around what seems to be a bug in FreeBSD.  Thanks to
      Mike Watkins for helping track it down.


0.5 (2002-09-05)

  scgi_server.py

    * Rewrite most of the scgi_server parent code.  Drop the table of
      busy children and the shared pipe between the parent and children.
      Instead, the children write a byte on the Unix domain pipe when they
      are ready for a request.  In the process, fix a bug that caused the
      parent to wait until all the children were ready before delegating a
      request (found by Changjune Kim).

  mod_scgi.c

    * Pass REMOTE_USER to SCGI server (patch from Hamish Lawson).


0.4 (2002-07-31)

  quixote_handler.py

    * Make debug() message a little more useful when we catch IOError on
      closing connection.

   scgi_server.py

    * Fix a bug that caused the manager process to hang.  The hang was
      trigged when the maximum number of child processes were running
      and one died while the manager was trying to find an idle child to
      process a request.


0.3 (2002-06-04)

  mod_scgi.c:

    * disable verbose debugging output

    * if the connection to the SCGI server is refused, sleep a little
      and try again since it might have been restarted (as opposed giving
      up right away and returning a 500 error to the poor user)

  scgi_server.py:

    * restart interrupted select() calls

    * remove graceful restart code (on HUP signal) in scgi_server.py.  It's
      complicated and now that mod_scgi retries it's not needed.

  quixote_handler.py:

    * close stdin

/* vim: set ai tw=74 et sw=4 sts=4: */
